		<p>The dark can be scary, the fear of the unknown. However, in order to overcome those fears, the only way is to step into it and bring light. Meeting new people and being in a new place scared me, but once I spent more time in the city, I got used to how to get from place to place. The same can be said when it comes to people. You might not see your potential, but it is there, you just need to know how to express it and let it shine. No one should compare their worth or skills to someone else, but look at it as a way to push yourself to become something bigger.</p>
		<p>Life is hard. But the feeling of finally getting things that have been piling up done, the relaxation is worth it. You cannot constantly get, or else you will lose sight of independence and hard worked skills. Noone can own the world or control their life/other people's life just for their own greed. In life, you need to go through valleys, in order to go through hills. Its unfair, but that is what experience is all about. Then, after a hard day's at work or school, you come home to relax all the worries and troubles away, where ever home is.</p>
