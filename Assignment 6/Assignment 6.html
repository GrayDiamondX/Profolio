<p>I think, not only can martial arts teach the younge important lessons, but the people they learn it from. Children are impressionable, so when they see an adult doing something, they believe that, that is the right thing to do or that it is normal. It is important to respect your own life, your parents, your country, and the whole world, as long as it had taught you a lesson that can help you survive and is genuinly good.</p>

<p>Change WILL NOT happen if nothing is done. Change, an inevitable thing, has brought us to where we are. There have been marches for rights and political opinions, but also new businesses, buildings, and people. When waiting for someone, if they don't try to change, then they're not worth the time and effort. When changing yourself, you must do what you feel is right.</p>
