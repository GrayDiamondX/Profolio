<p>I don't really remember much about how the internet was when I was a child, and seeing as how the author grew up with it AS the Internet kept evolving. "Which is to say I witnessed it all, and as a particularly lonely child, I witnessed it rather closely: Neopets in elementary school, the birth of Myspace in middle school, the rise of Facebook in early high school, Instagram in late high school, the internet culture wars of infamy as a freshman in college, Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica in graduate school" (paragraph 2). Even though I was also around when the Internet was being made, my childhood was quite different. Most of my childhood was spent playing at the park or watching tv like PBS Kids or Qubo, so seeing as how the author grew up with Neopets in elementary school and experienced the birth of Myspace and Facebook makes me surprised. </p>

<p>In the sentence, "Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre-social media internet. The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet" (paragraph 4), though I am not their age or older, I can agree that I also miss pre-social media times. Of course, social media has brought so many people together around the world, but I miss sitting in front of the tv and watching Sesame Street or Barney for hours on end. Then, in the sentence, "Considering the average website is less than ten years old, that old warning from your parents that says to "be careful what you post online because it'll be there forever"' (paragraph 6), because the internet is so big, someone, somewhere could have saved something you posted, which causes me to worry about what I post all the time. I'm aware of what the author says in the next sentence, but as someone who saves or screenshots something that I like, even when a website goes down and has the possibility that the original post is long gone, I will have a piece of what used to be in my photos. For example, YouTube had announced that they will be taking down channels and videos that are no longer producing views or updating. So, as you might have guessed, people started to freak out and download old videos just in case they disappear. I, again, am one of those people. </p>

<p>I was VERY surprised to see, "It's important to note here the subversive, deliberately ugly aesthetics of so-called "Weird Facebook" groups, with titles like "Please show to Jim ! ! HA ! ! HA ! !" or "we are all god's children and he left us in a hot car"' (paragraph 31). It's been a while since I heard that kind of joke about being left in a car, causing me to laugh. But that aside, it is a little nostalgic to see people still making those kinds of jokes since we as a society, don't make them anymore due to it being, "cringy" or "too old." The author then continues this by stating that the newer generations mock the rest of the aging denizens, which I can totally understand. I'm a little old school myself, I'm not caught up with what celebrities are new or which ones did what horrible act, so when I don't hear or see anyone talking the way I do or understanding the jokes I make, I feel incredibly old. I did, however, like the ending to their journal, "It's about time for a little revenge from the old internet. Or how about revenge from the older, older internet: communism. ... All that is solid melts into air, bitch" (final paragraph). Many people don't like to be made fun of, especially when something nostalgic to them, is a joke to others. I don't really get why the author chose communism as the solution, however. </p>
