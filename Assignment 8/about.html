<p>I've always liked anime and cartoons. On my anime ranking list, I put "Dr. Stone" at the top because though its about science, I like the art style and the creative ways the creator incorporated science. Its genuinely funny and really cool. I recommend watching it! Second on the list is "Violet Evergarden". If you want an anime that can make you cry, highly recommend! Every episode made me cry, and A few years ago, I wasn't a very senitive person, so it suprised me when I started crying. Though I feel the story plot could have done a little more when it came to the people around Violet, its a really good anime with super pretty graphics and design. Lastly, "Love is Hard for Otaku". Its a slice of life anime. I love the dynamics of the characters and how they play into each other. Its relatable and super funny, focusing around 4-6 people in a work company/college life. The ending of the anime series was lacking, because in the manga the creator went into more detail about the final two characters and how they interact. Either they haven't animated it, or I missed it.</p>

<p>In the cartoon ranking list, I placed "The Owl House" first. This cartoon falls in the line of "Gravity Falls", "Steven Universe", "Amphibia", etc. This cartoon plays into another dimention where the magical creatures we know are not real, REAL. The action is cool and I like the interactions of all the characters. The message of the cartoon is even though you're a little different, weirdos stick together, and how to accept yourself even when others can't. Second on the list is "Steven Universe". A little older cartoon, but one that my brother and I really loved. The songs are SUPER catchy, theres a lot of bagage, trauma, and mental illnesses, but solve how to accept them and make a change. Though some characters could have had more sceene time, that didn't stop viewers from loving them. Finally, "Adventure Time!" I LOVE Adventure Time. I placed it last because sometimes, the plot can be all over the place, but its still on my top 3. Its an action fantasy cartoon with lots of adventuring, feelings, consequences, and loveable characters. They released a spinoff of gender swap characters called "Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake" which is SO good go watch it!</p>

<p>Finally are my quotes! I picked a few that made me feel something and some I find really funny. I reused the quotes from Ursula K Le because I still feel like they're words of inspiration and wisdome. I also included Qutoes from Luz (from The Owl House) and Jake (from Adventure Time) because though they are the more comedy relief characters, they have great funny quotes and really heart hitting ones. Last, I included some streamers that I've been watching for years. Ranboo is super funny and will always make me laugh, Wilbur in unhinged, and Technoblde has and will always make my day. Technoblade passed away last year and I always try to incorporate him in my writing/art because when times got rough for me, I always felt comfort in watching his videos. RIP king.</p>
